# Nomic Game Engine Enhancements Design Document

This document outlines the proposed changes to the Nomic game engine to support dynamic rule management and compliance checking. The enhancements include updates to the Rule class, the introduction of a new RuleComplianceChecker, modifications to the NomicGame class, and an integration testing plan.

## Updated Rule Class

The Rule class will be updated to include:

- A unique identifier for each rule.
- A description field to explain the rule.
- A method to evaluate the rule against a given game state.

## New RuleComplianceChecker

The RuleComplianceChecker will be a new component responsible for:

- Evaluating game states against the active rules.
- Determining if a move is valid according to the current rules.
- Providing feedback on why a move is invalid, if applicable.

## Modifications to the NomicGame Class

The NomicGame class will be modified to:

- Dynamically manage the list of active rules.
- Interface with the RuleComplianceChecker to validate moves.
- Allow for rules to be added, removed, or modified during gameplay.

## Integration Testing Plan

The integration testing plan will include:

- Test cases for each new feature and modification.
- Tests to ensure backward compatibility with existing game logic.
- Tests to verify the integrity of the game state throughout gameplay.

## Expected Behaviors, Interfaces, and Interactions

- The Rule class will expose an interface for evaluating a rule against a game state.
- The RuleComplianceChecker will interact with the Rule class and the NomicGame class to validate moves.
- The NomicGame class will manage rules and interact with the RuleComplianceChecker to ensure game integrity.

## Maintaining Backward Compatibility and Code Integrity

- All changes will be implemented in a way that does not break existing game logic.
- New features will be modular to facilitate easy integration and testing.
- Comprehensive testing will ensure that the game's integrity is maintained throughout all changes.

This design document provides a roadmap for enhancing the Nomic game engine to support dynamic rule management and compliance checking, ensuring a robust and flexible game experience.

## Architectural Review Findings and Prototyping Results

- Identified Risks: Initial review highlighted potential performance bottlenecks with the dynamic rule evaluation engine under high load scenarios. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the scalability of the RuleComplianceChecker when integrating with external rule sets.

- Integration Challenges: Integrating new features while ensuring backward compatibility poses significant challenges. The modular design approach mitigates some risks but requires careful consideration of interface changes to avoid breaking existing functionalities.

- Prototyping Results: Early prototyping efforts have demonstrated the feasibility of integrating new rule management features with minimal impact on existing game logic. However, adjustments to the proposed design are necessary to address performance and scalability concerns. These include optimizing the rule evaluation engine and enhancing the modularity of the RuleComplianceChecker.

Based on these findings, necessary adjustments to the proposed design will be implemented to ensure a seamless integration of new features while maintaining the integrity and performance of the game engine.
